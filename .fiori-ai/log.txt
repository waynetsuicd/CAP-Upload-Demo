==========LLM call for step "extractAppSkeleton":==========
You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

A Fiori Elements application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their to-many associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the to-many associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

==========LLM call for step "extractListReport":==========
A Fiori Elements Application has the following pages:
 - ListReport page for "Files"
 - ObjectPage for "Files"

Available entities with their associations and elements are:
Entity "Files"
   Properties:
       fileId: A unique identifier for the file.
       filename: The name of the uploaded file.
       mediaType: The type of file (e.g. sales, service, employment).
       fileContent: The content of the uploaded file, stored in the database as large binary stream data.

The user input below describes the details of the ListReport page (i.e. its filters, tables or views with their columns).

Your task is to help the user defining the ListReport page.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

I want to create an SAP Fiori elements application that can upload file in the system
Description
I want to create and upload text file in the system.
Files
file: A file involves defining a structured representation of a file.
Common attributes of a file might include:
file ID: A unique identifier for the file.
1. file ID: A unique identifier for the file.
2. filename: The name about uploaded file
"3. media Type: The type of file (e.g. sales, service, employment)."

Scenario 1: List All files
"Given I am logged into the file management system, when I launch the SAP Fiori application to maintain files,"
then I should be able to view the list of all the files in a list without pressing the GO button.
"The list of all the files should have : file ID, file name, file media Type."

==========LLM call for step "extractSingleObjectPageOfMany":==========
The user input below describes a Fiori Elements Application with the following pages:
 - ListReport page for "Files"
 - ObjectPage for "Files"

Your task is to find the details of the ObjectPage for "Files".
The base entity of the ObjectPage is Files.
This ObjectPage can contain tabs and/or sections which in turn contain tables and fields.

The underlying data model allows the following propertyPaths:
 - fileId: File Id (of File)
 - filename: Filename (of File)
 - mediaType: Media Type (of File)
 - fileContent: File Content (of File)

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:

==========LLM call for step "extractColors":==========
You help the user creating a Fiori Elements application based on user input describing such an application.
Your task is to determine whether the entity properties can be considered good and bad in most contexts or are usually neutral. When in doubt, set to neutral.

These are the entity properties and their values:
Entity: Files, Property: mediaType, Values: sales, service, employment

If the properties can be considered good and bad, the allowed values for their criticality and the associated colors are:
   negative: red
   critical: yellow or orange
   positive: green
   neutral:  grey

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}

==========LLM call for data generation:==========

For the following list of entities, create data for the empty CSV files.
Entity "Files" - Properties:
    fileId: String(50), A unique identifier for the file.
    filename: String(255), The name of the uploaded file.
    mediaType: String(50), The type of file (e.g. sales, service, employment).
    fileContent: String, The content of the uploaded file, stored in the database as large binary stream data.

Empty CSV files in json format (only generate content for these files!):
{"Files.csv":"fileId;filename;mediaType;fileContent"}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.
    
Use format for values:
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
    
For the following fields, use only the supplied allowed values (as they are, don't insert spaces or change case):
- mediaType (of Files): sales, service, employment

Example output (Do NOT include in output!):
```json
